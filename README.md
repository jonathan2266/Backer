Compile BackerV2

Run once and it will create a backer.cnf file with basic intructions.
add source and destination path each on there line like this "c:\User\something\xxx"
For the next run it will try and copy the files.
Failures and other errors will be written in the BackerV2Logs that pops up and gets overwritten with every new run.
The destination folder will contain folders with a date and time as name.
Possible to copy a single file to.
